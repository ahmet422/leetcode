| Difficulty | Topics | Acceptance | Total Accepted | Total Submissions |
| :-: | :-: | --: | --: | --: |
| Medium | [Hash Table](https://leetcode.com/tag/hash-table/), [Heap](https://leetcode.com/tag/heap/) | 54.56% | 198.7K | 364.1K |

### Problem:

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

Note:

- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
- Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
