| Difficulty | Topics | Acceptance | Total Accepted | Total Submissions |
| :-: | :-: | --: | --: | --: |
| Easy | [Array](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/), [Divide and Conquer](https://leetcode.com/tag/divide-and-conquer/), [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/) | 43.27% | 503.8K | 1.2M |

### Problem:

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

**Follow up:**

If you have figured out the O(*n*) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
