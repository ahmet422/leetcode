| Difficulty | Topics | Acceptance | Total Accepted | Total Submissions |
| :-: | :-: | --: | --: | --: |

### Problem:

Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Example 1:

```
Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

Note:

1. You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than *O*(*n*2).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
