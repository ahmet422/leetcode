### Problem:

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

```
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
