### Problem:

Given two sorted integer arrays *nums1* and *nums2*, merge *nums2* into *nums1* as one sorted array.

**Note:**

- The number of elements initialized in *nums1* and *nums2* are *m* and *n* respectively.
- You may assume that *nums1* has enough space (size that is greater or equal to *m* + *n*) to hold additional elements from *nums2*.

**Example:**

```
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```
